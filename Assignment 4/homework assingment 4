~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HiRisq Insurance company determines auto insurance rates based on a driver’s age, 
number of tickets in the last three years, and the value of the car. Your task is to 
create a new class called "Driver" where one object of class Driver stores and 
calculates the data for one driver. Of course you will also need a second class 
TestDriver to test your class Driver. Use the following as class TestDriver 
to test your new class:

/**
 * Tests class Driver by reading the data, calculating and printing
 * out the insurance premiums for four different drivers.
 */
class TestDriver {
      public static void main(String args[])  {
            Driver driver;
            driver = new Driver();
            driver.read();
            System.out.println("Premium: $" + driver.premium());
            driver.read();
            System.out.println("Premium: $" + driver.premium());
            driver.read();
            System.out.println("Premium: $" + driver.premium());
            driver.read();
            System.out.println("Premium: $" + driver.premium());
      }
}

Be sure that you understand what every line in the program above is supposed 
to do before you proceed.

Once you are ready to write the method that calculates the driver's premium, 
use the following rules: The base premium is 5 percent of the value of the car. 
Drivers under 25 years old pay 15 percent more and drivers from 25 through 29 
pay 10 percent more. A driver with one ticket pays 10 percent over the 
premium already figured. Two tickets draws a 25 percent extra charge; 
three tickets adds 50 percent; and drivers with more than three tickets 
are refused.

Type the following values in when you run your program, user input is 
shown in bold:

Driver’s Age? 35

Number of Tickets? 1

Value of Car? 10000

Premium: $550.00

Driver’s Age? 29

Number of Tickets? 2

Value of Car? 15000

Premium: $1031.25

Driver’s Age? 19

Number of Tickets? 3

Value of Car? 850

Premium: $73.31

Driver’s Age? 81

Number of Tickets? 4

Value of Car? 12500

Premium: $0

Notes:

• To calculate the premium, first apply the base rate of 5% * value of the car to get the base 
premium, and then add a percentage of that premium for the age of the driver, and then add a 
percentage of that premium for the number of tickets. For example, for the driver age 19:

      Premium = (850 * .05)* 1.15 * 1.50 = 73.3125

                            ^                ^         ^

                    car value         age    tickets

• Structure the branches in the method of class Driver so that you have NO code duplication

• Once you get the output correct to the nearest penny, use class DecimalFormat in main() 
to format the value that is returned from the premium() method. Your final output will show 
just two digits to the right of the decimal point.

In order to receive full credit:

- Define all member variables private

- include Javadoc comments for each class and each method. The comment for the class must 
tell what one object of the class represents; the comment for each method must tell what 
the method does with its parameters, what it returns, whether it does any 
reading or writing, etc.

- Define class TestDriver exactly as is specified in the assignment instructions. 
The only change that you are allowed to make is to add an object of class DecimalFormat 
to format the double that is returned from the premium() method.

- Make sure your output is exactly as specified in the assignment instructions.

- Have no repeated code in your premium() method.

- Do not test for conditions that you know are true.

- Define your premium() method with no input from keyboard and no output to screen.

- Your premium() method must return a double

- Follow all program guidelines
