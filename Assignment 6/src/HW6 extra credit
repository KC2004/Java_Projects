(worth 2 points)Save
In this extra credit assignment, worth a maximum of 2 points, you will add some methods 
to the class List that you wrote for Assignment #6.

Step 1) Make any and all modifications to your class List that were suggested 
by me in the comments I made to your submission of Assignment #6.

Step 2) Add a method called sort() to class List that sorts the integers in the List in ascending order.

Step 3) Add a method called getElement() that takes an int index as parameter 
and returns the element that is in the list at that index. Make sure that you 
check that the int index parameter is within the bounds of the array before 
you use it to access the array.

Step 4) Write a main() that proves that all of the methods in class List work, 
even the methods that you wrote and tested for Assignment #6.

As always, you will save a LOT of time by writing the call in the main() to a 
method BEFORE you write the method definition itself. Don't forget to follow 
all program guidelines and paste the run to the bottom of one of your source code files.

NOTE that you have only one try for submitting this extra credit assignment! 
That is because we all really need to be focussing on the project at this point in the term.
